# Python-Socket-MastermindGame

This project I developed with my university teammates using socket programming to create a multiplayer Mastermind game. The server handles player connections, game logic, turn-based gameplay, and guess validation. Players send 6-digit guesses, and the server provides feedback on correctness, tracking the number of correct digits in the right position and in any position. The game continues until a player wins or the maximum number of guesses is reached. This project demonstrates the use of sockets, threading, and real-time multiplayer interaction.
